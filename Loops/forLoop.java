        /* what is the need of study diffrent type loop when they worked similarly?
         ans. when we know no of ittration means howmany time our loops will be excuting so then we use for loop.
         but when we don't know howmany time our loop will we excuting there we use do- while or while loops.
         now diffrence between these when we want if our condition is false then also run once so you have to use do-while
         loop but if we want if our condition is false so don't want to excute any time so you can use while loop.
